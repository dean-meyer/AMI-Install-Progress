# AMI-Install-Progress
This will be used for tracking the progress of Advanced Metering Infrastructure installation across Augusta Richmond County. It will include an interactive map showing:
+ Our overall plan for installation
+ Our current install focus area
+ Anticipated install areas for the next 30 days

The map is built with (https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/)[Folium] and data is ingested from AUD data sources.
